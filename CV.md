## Summary

I am a software engineer with experience in full-stack software development for
the web, devops, technical leadership, hiring, mentoring and remote work.

I've worked on both greenfield projects and legacy systems, as a single
developer and as part of a team, remotely and on-site. I believe I'm capable of
learning new things and finding my way around a complex system quickly, coming
up with pragmatic, simple solutions where possible and managing complexity when
it's inevitable, communicating effectively with both non-tech and tech people.

Some of the technologies, tools and techniques that I've used extensively:
ruby, rails, postgres, docker, terraform, AWS, TDD, CI/CD.

## What I'm looking for

I'm looking for part-time (~25 hours/week) remote work with flexible hours. I
can of course occasionally work on-site and attend meetings in London or
elsewhere in the UK. Ideally I'd like to work on projects that align with the
"Tech for Good" principles: http://www.techforgood.global/principles/

## Past work

### 2009 - Jan 2019: Senior Software Engineer at Loco2. London, UK

Loco2 is an online journey planner and booking service for train and bus travel
in the UK and Europe. I had been with the business from the very early days
when I was the only developer working on the prototype, through multiple stages
of growth, acquisition by SNCF (the French rail operator) in 2017 and
subsequent expansion of the team.

Prior to acquisition Loco2 had been a small team with a strong sense of
ownership of all aspects of the product: everyone had a wide range of
responsibilities and a say on decisions. We've built a culture of transparency,
honesty and trust that together with lightweight but solid processes enabled
both autonomy and effective collaboration. All developers had access to all
data, communicated directly with customers and worked on and deployed all parts
of the tech stack. The team was (and still is) distributed, optimised for
remote work and all developers worked remotely (in the UK and Europe).

The tech stack consisted of:

* Monolith Rails app (which evolved from the original prototype and was kept up
to date with the recent versions of ruby, rails and other dependencies).
* Ruby module for routing and interacting with booking operator's APIs (often
SOAP, some REST). 
* iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin) apps which are thin wrappers around WebView.
* React/TypeScript frontend: we've started to migrate the original Rails/JQuery
MPA to a React SPA.
* Hosting on AWS using docker and ECS with autoscaling, Postgres RDS, Redis
ElastiCache.
* Infrastructure as code using Terraform. 
* Continuous integration using TravisCI (automated tests, visual regression
testing, docker builds).
* Continuous deployment: a push to master in git triggers a build and automatic
deployment to production on success. 
* Various tools for data analysis: Librato, Papertrail, Mixpanel, Blazer.

Some of the challenges we've had to address while building Loco2 (I have either
worked on or have been involved in these):

* Prioritisation and focus to get things done while being a small team.
* Integration of (often ancient) 3rd party booking APIs. 
* Maintaining large dataset of station data.
* PCI DSS compliance and payment fraud.
* Minimising operations overhead (cloud hosting, monitoring, scaling, CD).
* I18n & L10n (multiple languages and currencies).
* Supporting affiliate partners (API, tracking and reporting for affiliates).
* Acquisition due diligence.
* Expanding the team while maintaining productivity.

More recently I worked on leading backend projects, maintaining the
infrastructure, onboarding and mentoring new developers.

### 2004 - 2012: Remote contract work

I've worked on many projects as a remote contractor. Some examples: 

#### Shopify

I've been contracted by Shopify to build several apps to help their customers
migrate data from other platforms (Magento, Wordpress, eBay, etc) to Shopify.
These were implemented as a single modular Rails app hosted on Heroku.

#### Arts Organisations in Australia

I've worked on websites for a few nonprofit arts organisations based in
Australia, including The Australian Center for Photography, which is the
country's leading arts centre for the exhibition and publication of, and
education in photo-based practice and INAPAC which is the representative body
for Performing Arts Centers in NSW and ACT, Australia.

These projects required functionality like content management, e-Commerce,
workshop enrolments management, events calendar, data sharing and reporting. In
terms of technology these were Rails apps hosted on Linux VPS.

#### Other projects

I've worked on many smaller projects for clients from all over the world. Some
feedback on those can be found here: https://www.freelancer.com/u/EugeneB

### 2007 - 2009: Senior Software Developer / CTO at AuctionPAL. Boston, MA, USA

AuctionPAL was a start-up based in Boston that aimed to simplify selling on
online platforms. I worked as part of a distributed team first remotely and
then on-site. In terms of technology there were several Rails front-end apps
and a Java backend initially hosted on dedicated Linux servers. The system was
integrated with various 3rd party e-Commerce and shipping APIs, enabled
inventory management including OCR to process manifests from suppliers.

My role involved working on the Rails apps, collaborating with the marketing
department, managing the on-site development team. Eventually I took over
maintenance of the entire codebase, worked on simplifying production and
development infrastructure and automating routine processes.

### 2006 - 2007 Web Developer at SPN Group. St Petersburg, Russia

SPN Group was a publishing house that produced several magazines including the
Russian version of the "Rolling Stone". I've worked as part of the web
development team on a PHP framework / content management system behind the
online versions of the magazines. 

## Education

CS Degree in "Automated Data Processing and Control Systems" from Astrakhan
State Technical University (Russia), 2006.

## Background

I'm originally from Russia, but have been living in the UK since 2012 and I
have an Indefinite Leave to Remain, which allows me to live and work in the UK
without any restrictions. I currently live in Letchworth Garden City,
Hertfordshire.
